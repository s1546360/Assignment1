Despite recent declines in poverty, Nepal remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Rural communities often struggle with household food security and are extremely vulnerable to frequent natural hazards, including flash floods, landslides and earthquakes. Poverty affords communities few resources to prepare for or mitigate the effects of these hazards and even fewer resources to recover, which can destroy development gains. LWR promotes resilience and long-term development in the communities in which it works by better preparing communities for natural hazards and helping families realize food security and savings. In Nepal, LWR currently works with local partners on agriculture, food security, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DRR) projects.

Meanwhile, our coordination with the World Health Organization indicates that areas more remote than Kathmandu require aid, so we will transport volunteers daily from Deerwalk facilities to red zones in order to maximize our resources.\n\nThe WHO is still assessing the situation and will get back to us soon on which remote areas are in the most dire need.

Swiss Humanitarian Aid sent a rapid response team to Nepal the day after the disaster struck. On 28 April 2015 it also sent ateam comprised of eight medical specialists and two logisticsspecialists. The FDFA is providing people travelling in Nepal or planning to do so with information on the situation. The Swiss embassyin Kathmandu is in close contact with the local authorities and is stilltrying to obtain information about Swiss nationals in the region. The Crisis Management Centre (KMZ) in Bern is coordinating all operations relating to Swiss nationals in Nepal.

The deployment of the team of doctors by the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit is the first response measure to be taken following an initial assessment of the situation by the rapid response team sent to the region on 26 April 2015 in the wake of the devastating earthquake in the Himalayas.\n\nThe \u201cMother and Child\u201d unit is a rapid response medical team deployed by the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit. On Tuesday evening, eight medical personnel and two logistics experts will depart from Belp airport for Nepal. The team will travel on the Federal Council\u2019s official jet in cooperation with the Swiss Air Force operated by the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS).\n\nThe \u201cMother and Child\u201d rapid response team was set up based on experience acquired following the earthquake in Haiti. Medical personnel can be sent to reinforce existing health teams only a few days after a disaster hits. Central to their work are surgical operations on children and childbirth support. The team will take with it the medical equipment needed for its work. The flight on 28 April 2015 will carry 562 kg of equipment. Together with personal equipment, the plane will thus have a total cargo of 1 tonne.\n\nThe Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit decided to deploy this 10-strong team following an evaluation by the advance detachment sent on Sunday, 26 April. The six-member group of experts assessed the situation and the requirements in the disaster area upon their arrival in the Nepalese capital, took charge of coordination with the authorities and the local partners on the ground, supplied first aid and supported the Swiss embassy and the cooperation office of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation in Kathmandu. The plan is for this team to be joined by eight specialists from the Swiss Disaster Relief Unit. A larger consignment of aid is scheduled to be delivered on Thursday, 30 April 2015."@en .

Standby Partners (SBP) work together with ETC through WFP. SBP are organizations, including Government Agencies, NGOs and foundations, who have signed an agreement with WFP to maintain a roster of rapidly deployable staff (within 72H) and equipment to support WFP emergency operations - Profiles available for deployment depend on the individual organisation, but typically include Telecommunications and IT specialists, electricians and project managers.\nAccess to Situation reports, Project reports, Meeting minutes, Maps and photos is gained by becoming a registered user.

It contains non-injectable drugs, medical supplies and some essential equipment, accompanied by simple treatment guidelines. Basic equipment also has a complete sterilization set and items to help provide for clean water at the health facility. The supplementary unit contains drugs, renewable supplies and equipment needed by doctors working in first- or second-referral health facilities.\n\nOn May 3, WHO visited Gorkha district to identify the need for a WHO field office. In Gorkha there are currently seven village development committees that have not received support and little information exists from these sites.

The next round of distributions will depend on the arrival of relief supplies being airlifted in from Dubai. The shipments include 5,000 tarpaulins that are loaded and waiting to fly. Additional supplies are being airlifted from a regional warehouse and include hygiene kits, cooking kits, mosquito nets, sleeping bags, sleeping mats, buckets, and water purification tablets. A team has been sent out to assess the damage in rural areas.World Vision plans to set up 15 child-friendly spaces and temporary learning centers so children have a safe space to play and study following the trauma of the quake while their families are in transition. The first child-friendly space opened in Kathmandu April 30."@en ;
