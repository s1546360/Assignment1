Himalayan Healthcare is an organization whose focus is the health of the people of the region and their clinics are an integral part of life in the region.  Cardio Start has adapted a planned trip to the region for solely cardiac care to meet a more general need.  Remote Area Medical and International Medical Relief are responding specifically to the crisis.  IMR (based in Loveland, Co.) has a minimum of 5 teams traveling to Nepal over the coming weeks for medical purposes. \nSpecifically regarding Himalayan Healthcare, Brother\u2019s Brother is supporting a team of international doctors leaving this weekend to supplement the work of the 40 permanent in country Nepalese staff.

Several clinics operated by Himalayan Healthcare in the villages of Tipling, Sherthung, Borang, Lapa and Jharlang were completely destroyed.  The international team of physicians will be a small team and will be in country for up to three weeks.\nBBF itself will continue to support the work of organizations sending teams in the coming weeks and months.  Also as Himalayan Health Care articulates the needs of their clinics in the region BBF will continue our partnership with them to meet their needs as they arise.\n(via e-mail)",

Despite recent declines in poverty, Nepal remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Rural communities often struggle with household food security and are extremely vulnerable to frequent natural hazards, including flash floods, landslides and earthquakes. Poverty affords communities few resources to prepare for or mitigate the effects of these hazards and even fewer resources to recover, which can destroy development gains. LWR promotes resilience and long-term development in the communities in which it works by better preparing communities for natural hazards and helping families realize food security and savings. In Nepal, LWR currently works with local partners on agriculture, food security, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DRR) projects. LWR's work focuses on areas of western Nepal.",

At the transit shelter - tracing the families of the victims to send them safely back home to their villages and receiving new arrivals.\nImmediate Relief - Emergency supplies to hospitals: got a request from a hospital to provide 200 beds and bedding, which will be delivered on April 27. / Providing supplies to temporary shelters: NYF plans to provide support focusing the efforts on children and pregnant women.

Meanwhile, our coordination with the World Health Organization indicates that areas more remote than Kathmandu require aid, so we will transport volunteers daily from Deerwalk facilities to red zones in order to maximize our resources.\n\nThe WHO is still assessing the situation and will get back to us soon on which remote areas are in the most dire need. The WHO is working in tandem with the Nepal Ministry of Health, so in this situation WHO = Nepal Government.

The deployment of the team of doctors by the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit is the first response measure to be taken following an initial assessment of the situation by the rapid response team sent to the region on 26 April 2015 in the wake of the devastating earthquake in the Himalayas.\n\nThe \u201cMother and Child\u201d unit is a rapid response medical team deployed by the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit.

Medical personnel can be sent to reinforce existing health teams only a few days after a disaster hits. Central to their work are surgical operations on children and childbirth support. The team will take with it the medical equipment needed for its work. The flight on 28 April 2015 will carry 562 kg of equipment. Together with personal equipment, the plane will thus have a total cargo of 1 tonne.\n\nThe Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit decided to deploy this 10-strong team following an evaluation by the advance detachment sent on Sunday, 26 April.

Is trying to identify a second \u201cstrategic entry point\u201d to the region, so relief groups can use smaller cargo aircraft and fly in more frequently. Will monitor rate of local recovery; future tasks to be determined by types of economic structures in place.  \n\nAdditional Logistics Cluster hubs including Pokhara and Birganj are planned to be established.
